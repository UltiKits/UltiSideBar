/**
 * Copies the server's main scoreboard teams onto a private scoreboard.
 * <p>
 * A player sees team prefixes, suffixes, colours and name-tag options only from the scoreboard they
 * are viewing. Moving a player onto a private sidebar board would therefore hide every main-board
 * team from them: name prefixes from other modules, vanilla {@code /team} teams and other plugins'
 * teams. Each module that gives a player a private board carries the main board's teams onto it
 * (maintainer decision 2026-09-27, UltiKits/UltiSideBar#27). The main board stays the single owner
 * of teams: the copy follows it and never writes back.
 * <p>
 * The copy is a diff: a team or attribute that already matches is not written again, so an
 * unchanged team costs no scoreboard writes. Teams on the private board that no longer exist on the
 * main board are unregistered; the private board holds no team of its own.
